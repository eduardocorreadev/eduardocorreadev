<h1 style='color: #03adfc; font-weight: bold;'>⭐ Hello Dev ⭐</h1>

I have no idea what you're doing here or how you got here, but since you're here, I'll try to show you a little bit about myself.

## Public information

My name is Carlos Eduardo and I live in a small town in the interior of São Paulo, Brazil.

## Detailed information

* **Name**: Carlos Eduardo
* **Age**: 19
* **Living in**: Itobi, São Paulo, Brazil

## Curiosities about me

* I started programming at the age of 15 because of Minecraft Servers. Using the Java Language for Plugins.

* When developing for Minecraft servers, I didn't have much sense of what I was doing, so it was changing lines and taking the "trial / error" approach just to see if something changed in the game.

* Today my main focus is to work with web development. 

* I started to focus on web development in 2018, also because of the Minecraft Game. On a server we had the great idea of ​​making a website for the server. And I say great because that idea changed my life. I offered to do the site because I thought, "It shouldn't be that hard", but I had no experience. I started using platforms like Mix to create the site, but I wanted to see better how it worked and I started to like it so much that until today I haven't stopped.

* The first course I attended was from **Curso em Vídeo**.

* I love DC's The Flash series, that's why Avatar xD

## Important Phrase
**A simple game can change lives**
